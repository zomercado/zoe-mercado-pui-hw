# **FP1 \- Proposal for Critique**

## Idea Sketches

### *Idea 1: Creole Language Map*

![Creole Language Map](images/Interactive%20Map%20Lo-Fi%20Prototype.png)

Add a few sentences about your design. Briefly state the motivation of each project idea:

* **What is the basic idea of your final project?**  
The project uses an engaging, interactive map to highlight the spread of Caribbean Creole dialects (e.g., Haitian Creole, Papiamento, Jamaican Patois) and trace their roots back to African languages like Yoruba and Twi, illustrating the linguistic connections across the Afro-Caribbean diaspora.

* **How do you plan to make your design interactive and engaging?**  
Users can hover over the map and on a specific country to learn about it. They can also interact with clickable language cards on the map, flipping each to reveal the English translation of Caribbean phrases derived from African languages. This flip interaction adds a sense of exploration, making the experience more immersive.

* **How do you plan to make your design accessible?**  
The design will feature both text and audio representations of each phrase, allowing users to see and hear the language. I’ll also incorporate semantic HTML for better screen reader support, ensuring the content is accessible to users who rely on keyboard navigation.

* **What information do you specifically want to convey and include on your website?**
The site will highlight the names of Creole languages in each Caribbean country and include example phrases rooted in African languages. Additionally, it will convey the African influence in Caribbean culture by describing the regions in Africa from which each Caribbean country's linguistic and cultural roots largely originate.

### *Idea 2: Evolution of Soca*
![Evolution of Soca](images/Soca%20website%20lo-fi.png) 

![Evolution of Soca](images/Soca%20website%20lo-fi%202.png)

Add a few sentences about your design. Briefly state the motivation of each project idea:

* What is the basic idea of your final project? (1-2 sentences)  
An immersive experience to explore soca music and its evolution since its inception. Users can play selected tracks and watch as the visualizer responds dynamically to the beat, rhythm, and mood of the music.

* How do you plan to make your design interactive and engaging?  
The website will use a horizontal scroll navigation for users to explore the timeline of the genre. when the user clicks on the song timeline they can scroll along the musical staff to learn more about example songs that represent each era/sound.

* How do you plan to make your design accessible?  
I would ensure all interactive elements—like the timeline, play buttons, and scroll navigation—are accessible via keyboard. Visible focus indicators should highlight each element as users navigate. 

* What information do you specifically want to convey and include on your website?
The information on the site will include history of the genre, genre mechanics, and a gallery of what soca music looks like in context. The gallery specifically would have a list of songs from each year between 2000 and 2024, their album cover, and links to play the song on Youtube or Spotify. The visualizer would also display information about a soca song's level of bass, treble, vocals, and BPM.
…

### *Idea 3: Thrift Style Discovery*
![Thrift Style Discovery](images/Thrift%20Lo-Fi.png)

Add a few sentences about your design. Briefly state the motivation of each project idea:

* What is the basic idea of your final project?
Users can upload images of themselves trying on thrifted clothing and add notes about each piece. They can reflect on what they like or dislike, helping them track patterns in their style preferences over time and encouraging mindful fashion choices.

* How do you plan to make your design interactive and engaging? 
Users can upload images of themselves and assign pros and cons to each. Once they create an outfit card, they can edit them later on.

* How do you plan to make your design accessible?  
I will use high-contrast color combinations between text, background, and buttons to ensure readability for users with low vision or color blindness. I will also use  preset tags (such as “vintage,” “Y2K,” “neutral tones”) as well as a text entry option to lower cognitive load.  Using consistent tag language also supports better screen reader interpretation.

* What information do you specifically want to convey and include on your website?
The site will encourage users to explore their style evolution through tagging and categorizing entries (e.g., "Y2K," "vintage," "colorful") to quickly identify trends across outfits, colors, and styles. This categorization helps users develop a more personal and consistent style narrative.

## Feedback Summary

Summarize all the critiques you received during the lab session (\~300 words): 

Creole Language Map
* The layout of the phrases/map page was likened to a Venn diagram, which was not intended
* The card-flipping feature was praised as an excellent way to encourage user interactio as opposed to the speech bubble layout which wasn't as well received.
* Suggestions for visual adjustments included making the Caribbean map the main figure on the page and reducing the size of Africa as a thumbnail in the corner, as it's not the primary focus of exploration.
* A recommendation was made to implement hover functionality over countries, causing phrases/map buttons to appear instead of using a separate page.
* Another idea proposed highlighting related countries of origin in Africa when hovering over a Caribbean country.

An Evolution of Soca Music
* The addition of a play button was recommended to allow users to listen to music samples as they engage with the site.
* The immersive storytelling element was commended.
* A concern was raised about user guidance, specifically how to inform users that they should interact with the content horizontally.

Thrift Style Discovery Tool
* Drew comparisons to Pinterest 
* A feature allowing users to arrange clothing based on time was proposed, along with the addition of a filter function.
* An observation was made about the difficulty of describing why someone doesn't like a particular item.
* To address this, it was suggested that the app could allow users to write comments instead of trying to articulate specific dislikes.

## Feedback Digestion

Digest the feedback you got in the lab (\~300 words). Indicate which critique you will act on in your next design and why you chose to incorporate/dismiss pieces of critique.

Creole Language Map

I have decided to proceed with this concept, as it generated the most enthusiasm among participants. Several critiques highlighted the confusing layout of the phrases/map page, which resembled a Venn diagram rather than a straightforward map. The card-flipping feature was well-received for its interactivity, replacing the less engaging speech bubble design. Additionally, the suggestion for hover functionality over countries is promising. However, I will opt to display phrases/map buttons only upon clicking a country to avoid cluttering the interface with pop-ups. If feasible, I may implement a feature where related African countries are highlighted when hovering over Caribbean nations, enhancing the exploration experience.
In my next design, I will make Caribbean map the main figure on the page. The large, detailed map of the Caribbean will occupy the majority of the screen real estate, allowing users to clearly see individual countries and territories. In one corner of the screen, likely the bottom right, there would be a smaller thumbnail map of Africa. This would serve as a reference point for the origins of various Creole languages without distracting from the main Caribbean focus. This adjustment aligns with the core idea of exploring Caribbean islands in connection to Africa without overshadowing them.

An Evolution of Soca Music
I will act on the critique regarding user guidance for the horizontal scroll. Participants noted that clearer instructions are needed to encourage horizontal interaction with the content. To address this, I plan to add visual indicators, such as arrows or prompts, that explicitly instruct users to scroll sideways. By adding user guidance for the horizontal scroll, I aim to create a more intuitive experience that invites deeper exploration of the site without users feeling lost or frustrated.

Thrift Style Discovery Tool
In response to the critique about articulating dislikes, I will incorporate a comment feature. This allows users to express their thoughts more freely, addressing the difficulty of explaining why certain items don’t appeal to them. By allowing for personalized feedback, the app will better cater to individual preferences and enhance user experience.
